 		<p>Apex Legends stealth-released in a competitive genre. To the surprise of everyone, it not only was excellent but still is. The excellent mix of heroes to play as, the wonderful map design, and the extraordinarily good weapons make for a heady mixture. It helps that’s it’s always getting updated too, and you never quite know what to expect from the new character they put into the game. This might well be one of the best battle royale games out there, and you should definitely try it if you haven’t already. </p>

 		<h2>Left 4 Dead 2</h2>

 		<p>Some text..</p>
 		<p>Left 4 Dead 2 is the foundation of so many FPS games around nowadays. There are constant attempts to recreate the magic of this wonderful game, but so far no other game has captured the joy or sheer terror that Left 4 Dead 2 mastered. It’s a game all about surviving together with your friends against impossible odds. Or it’s a game about slaughtering foolish humans as the living dead, either way, it’s an awful lot of fun and you’d be a fool to not still be playing it.  </p>

		<h2>Valorant</h2>

		<p>Forgive us this little bit of speculation. While Valorant has only just gone into beta testing, we’ve all been watching the streams of it with bated breath. Fair to see it definitely looks good, as the odd offspring of the unholy union of Overwatch and CS:GO, but it looks like the people playing it are having fun too. Who can blame them, Riot knows how to make good games, and if this stacks up anywhere near as well next to their other games then it’s sure to be a huge success in the FPS space. </p>

 			 <h2>About Us</h2>

 			 <p>Hi everyone!

				This is CRANIAX, but around the Internet I go by Xerxes (don’t ask, its a weird story involving an elven name generator when I was 16).
				
				Video games have always been a part of my life. The first console I ever had was given to me by my grandmother. A translucent purple Gameboy Color packaged with Pokemon Gold. On my 18th birthday, I bought my final handheld console (for now) game, Pokemon Heart Gold for DS. Within that time I have enjoyed a plethora of console, pc and online games. I’m a sucker for anything Nintendo, but throughout college I’ve dabbled more into FPS on the Xbox360 and PS3 (mainly because these are the consoles my friends have).
				
				Favorite Game: Valorant
				
				Game I am best at: Dance Dance Revolution (any iteration, PC, console, arcade  — I will kick your butt, and yes this is a challenge).
				
				Recently, I’ve pulled away from video games, in an attempt to focus more on schoolwork. Hopefully this class will provide a healthy, and less obsessive return video games. I’m also looking forward to gaining an understanding of games as cultural artifacts rather than fun distractions from homework.</p>
